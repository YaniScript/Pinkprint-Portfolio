# Pinkprint-Portfolio

Welcome to my "Pinkprint-Portfolio". It's called this because my favorite color is pink, and you will find that it is pink! 
My favorite part of this portfolio is that when you click the link in the menu, it goes to the section in the portfolio!
It took me so long how to figure that out, and granted, it's not much in my portfolio _yet_ but there will be, and it'll be cool to see how the file
  interacts with this "jumpy-scrolly" thing in the future.

As always, I'm still growing in some areas. One being media queries. I only got it to work on one thing, but I couldn't get the menu with the links
to wrap/ move into a column. They disappear when the screen gets smaller - behind the main text. Also, I want to really utilize the tooltip feature in a 
meaningful way. It was malfunctioning when I tried to use it at the end of the document but maybe how I was trying to use it, and the element being at the
bottom of the page didn't help.

Nonetheless, lovvveeee my portfolio. I know it will only get better, and become more full with projects that I'm proud of. 

The portfolio itself is called "YaniScript-Portfolio", and it has been linked to the CSS file already.
