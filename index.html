            If someone would have told me when I was 21 years old, that at 30 years old, I would be choosing a life of chaos, confusion and
            stress as I embark on this journey of being a web developer, I would have called them a liar straight to their face...

    <section class="body-content">
        <p id="YANIscript-is">YANIscript is my alter-ego in this web development realm. I am YANIscript and she is me. The name is a play on the scripting language
            Javascript and I made my GitHub repository when the pun came to me, so the rest is history. I wanted to change it to "YANAscript" so 
            it sounds even more phonetically like Javascript but eff it, we ball! YANIscript is my exploration of who I am as a web developer. 
            Right now, she is raw; she is unpolished. Politically incorrect, if you will. But she will be the best to ever do it! So YANIscript 
            will be a commemoration of now and then (from a futuristic point of view.) I just want to document the journey so I can look back and 
            say, "Yeah, Yani - you did that...and that, and that!"
